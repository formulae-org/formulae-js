Fōrmulæ is a software framework for visualization, edition and mianipulation of complex expressions (either mathematical expressions or expressions from many other fields). If you want to know more about Fōrmulæ, please refer to its website [formulae.org](https://formulae.org).

### Fōrmulæ packages

Please notice that this repository contains only the core code (the framework). Code for visualizing, editing and manipulating expressions for a specific field —i.e. arithmetics— is grouped in a separate unit called a Fōrmulæ package. Every package has its own repository.

The main program is able to dynamically load packages. When the main program starts, it loads a set of base packages. The user can also choose for additional packages to be loaded.
